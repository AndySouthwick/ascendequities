      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <title>Trade Our Corporate Funds</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Since 2008 we've taught everyday people the skills necessary to become great traders. Whether they want to make a part time or full time income that is up to them. Our proprietary indicators give our students the edge necessary to successfully trade in today's markets. We teach our students one on one twice a week for 9 to 12 weeks which allows us to develop their skills and create a personalized trading plan centered around our proprietary indicators. Upon completion of their training we will fund our students day trading accounts to jump start them into live trading. We do quarterly reviews and if profitability is maintained we continue to add funds to their day trading account (up to $100,000) with our students keeping 60 to 80% of the profits. We are truly committed to our students success." />
